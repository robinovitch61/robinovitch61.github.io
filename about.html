        <h3>a cool guy, I swear:</h3>
        <i class="fake-quote">
            <p>"Leo asked me to write his bio because he was too busy working on paradigm-shifting projects to write it himself. Sure, I created a trillion dollar company and continue to give hundreds of millions of dollars to charity, but I'm nothing compared to this guy.</p>

            <p>I first met Leo in Kenya. I was on a safari, learning more about the various endangered species <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/">my foundation</a> hoped to save over the coming decades. As we neared one of the last Northern White Rhino's in the world, we saw that something was out of place.</p>

            <p>A human figure squatted near the massive rhino, stroking its head to comfort it with one hand and holding a huge viper in the other. Sending the rhino on its merry way, he spit out the venom he had sucked out of the rhino's leg. Bending down to safely release the snake, Leo looked up at our jeep, smiling and waving. I later learned that he was halfway through his monthly 200-mile barefoot run across the Sahara when he stopped to help the rhino, still finishing the run with a personal best time and able to continue volunteer work on the locally-run medical center that afternoon.</p>

            <p>While only some (or none) of this may be true, I would still heartily recommend this fine young man to anyone working on important and interesting problems."</p>

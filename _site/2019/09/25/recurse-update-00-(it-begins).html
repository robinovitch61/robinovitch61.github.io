It has been a whirlwind of orientation, meeting awesome people, learning about (and about the existence of) new cool things, set up, and settling in.

<br></br>
This was my second day here:
<div class="list-text">
    <br><i>8-9am: </i>Research blogging tools to create this very website. Decide on Jekyll + github pages + namecheap domain as a good solution</br>
    <br><i>9-10am: </i>Update MacOS to Mojave after experiencing ruby-related jekyll issues</br>
    <br><i>10-11am: </i>Using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">this great tutorial</a>, get <code>jekyll</code> and <code>bundler</code> installed. Get <code>jekyll serve</code> working and start developing this blog</br>
    <br><i>11-12pm: </i>Pair programming workshop! Create a version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> in python. <a href="https://gist.github.com/robinovitch61/8a094c15f8cc28ec9218a1baf6b211c6#file-game_of_life-py">Gist here.</a></br>
    <br><i>12-12:15pm: </i>Discuss wind speed measurements using an arduino with someone working on an auto-steering sailboat. Yay mech eng knowledge!</br>
    <br><i>12:15-1pm: </i>Lunch chat with someone, discuss what Rust is and why people are excited about it (memory and type safety)</br>
    <br><i>1-2pm: </i>Participated in an "Intro to Haskell" workshop. No loops, variables don't vary, unclear code execution order...what is this language??</br>
    <br><i>2-3pm: </i>Continue site development</br>
    <br><i>3-4pm: </i>Category theory discussion group. First foray into theoretical math in a long time. Approachable intro by the few folks with deeper knowledge on the topic</br>
    <br><i>4-5:30pm: </i>Further introductory Haskell chat, help solidify some core concepts intro'd earlier</br>
    <br><i>5:30-6:30pm: </i>Non-technical presentations (7 mins max) -- folks did them on cross stitching, rube goldberg machine demo, cats, contact juggling, architecture, and the origin of the English language</br>
</div>

<br></br>
It's everything I had hoped for and more.

<br></br>
The space is incredible, with tons of work stations, a large library, 5 or 6 old but working computers, breakout rooms, an LED project you can control via your computer, a nap space, and clean and functional kitchen/lunch area.

<br></br>
My goals here are (in no particular order):
<ul class="list-text">
    <li>Gain a stronger foundation in computer science theory (algorithms, data structures, complexity management, etc.)</li>
    <li>Continue to build on my statistics and probability knowledge, likely with some forays in to AI projects</li>
    <li>Learn of more "unknown unkowns" - concepts that I didn't know existed but are incredibly interesting and/or useful</li>
    <li>Reshape my assumptions about education and what the learning process looks like</li>
    <li>Become a much more effective programmer so I can kick ass at my next role</li>
</ul>

<br>
Some pitfalls I'd like to avoid:
<ul class="list-text">
    <li>Have my time dominated by learning tools rather than understanding concepts and theory. Learning a tool (e.g. a new programming language, framework, library, etc.) can be done when it's time to implement conceptually complete visions</li>
    <li>Stretch myself too thin by trying to learn everything and then feeling like I'm not really learning anything</li>
    <li>Get sucked in by "the hype" around a language or domain without properly evaluating whether or not it is the best way to spend my time at my current stage of development</li>
    <li>Lose steam by pushing too hard, feeling like I'm not succeeding, or failing to achieve my incremental goals</li>
</ul>

<br>
I'm so excited! Pitter patter...

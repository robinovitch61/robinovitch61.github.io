      <description>This is a bit of an uncomfortable public post for me. Talking about money in general can be uncomfortable, and talking about giving money can just come off as self-congratulatory. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s an important topic that will have positive impact when talked about more often.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been excited about GiveWell for a while now, and am interested in exploring the idea of doing the most good with money, time and effort.</description>

      <description>Today I spent some time learning more about how to draw with css. You can make a lot of shapes and designs with only css! I went off of https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/.
 .wrapper { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; } .shape { margin: 30px; height: max-content; } /* #circle { width: 0; height: 0; border: 50px solid black; border-radius: 50%; } */ #circle { width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: black; border-radius: 50%; } #oval { width: 200px; height: 100px; background-color: black; border-radius: 50%; } #triangle-up { width: 0; height: 0; border-bottom: 100px solid black; border-left: 60px solid transparent; border-right: 60px solid transparent; } #triangle-down { width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 100px solid black; border-left: 60px solid transparent; border-right: 60px solid transparent; } #triangle-left { width: 0; height: 0; border-right: 100px solid black; border-top: 60px solid transparent; border-bottom: 60px solid transparent; } #triangle-right { width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 100px solid black; border-top: 60px solid transparent; border-bottom: 60px solid transparent; } #border-explainer-middle { width: 50px; height: 50px; background-color: blue; border-top: 25px solid red; border-right: 25px solid green; border-left: 25px solid black; border-bottom: 25px solid orange; } #border-explainer { width: 50px; height: 50px; background-color: blue; border-top: 20px solid red; border-right: 20px solid green; border-left: 50px solid black; border-bottom: 50px solid orange; } #triangle-top-left { width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 100px solid black; border-bottom: 100px solid transparent; } #triangle-top-right { width: 0; height: 0; border-right: 100px solid black; border-bottom: 100px solid transparent; } #triangle-bottom-left { width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 100px solid black; border-top: 100px solid transparent; } #triangle-bottom-right { width: 0; height: 0; border-right: 100px solid black; border-top: 100px solid transparent; } #trapezoid-explainer { width: 50px; border-left: 40px solid red; border-right: 40px solid blue; border-bottom: 80px solid black; } #trapezoid { width: 50px; border-left: 40px solid transparent; border-right: 40px solid transparent; border-bottom: 80px solid black; } #parallelogram { width: 120px; height: 80px; background-color: black; transform: skew(20deg); } #star-of-david { width: 0; height: 0; border-bottom: 80px solid black; border-left: 45px solid transparent; border-right: 45px solid transparent; position: relative; } #star-of-david::after { content: &#34;</description>

      <description>Twitter bird - blue or purple?  About 6 weeks ago, I launched colorcontroversy.com. Since then, the site has collected over 800,000 color judgements and been shared around the web more than I expected.
A much-simplified version of Randal Monroe of XKCD&amp;rsquo;s color survey, the site shows you a color shade and presents two color choices for that shade. For example, it shows you a dark turquoise and asks you if it&amp;rsquo;s Green or Blue.</description>

      <description>I have been very fortunate to remain employed during this global pandemic. My productivity working from home has been about on par with what I had in the office, although my learning rate has gone down a bit due to the lack of water-cooler style chats about the product and software in general. We use Slack for remote chat and it feels a bit too formal to trigger notifications for offhand questions.</description>

      <description>Over the past year or so, I have gifted friends a few websites. I think the sites are fun, relatively unique gifts. As a bonus serve, they illustrate some of my progression with basic html/css/javascript static websites.
Site 1: averyrobins.com   I set up an Amazon S3 bucket for static hosting, bought a namecheap domain name, configured the custom DNS, and voila - I now pay $1/month to host this profanity-laden ASCII art.</description>

      <description>Note: this is my personal commentary and this post is not officially endorsed by Givewell in any way.
Givewell is one of the most admirable philanthropic organizations out there. They recognize and act upon a number of important truths:
 Money is a super powerful tool for reducing harm in the world Money can be used in more and less effective ways The effectiveness of money can be modeled with finite (possibly wide) uncertainty bounds at a non-trivial confidence level Encouraging those with the means to donate money to effective causes is important and worthwhile Moral judgement is an inseparable part of judging the effectiveness of an outcome  Not only does Givewell maintain an active blog, a Giving 101 section of its site, run free events in the Bay Area every few months and deliver well-curated email updates, but they keep updated copies of their Cost Effectiveness Models and Guide to Cost Effective Analysis available online for everyone to view.</description>

      <title>concurrency in python</title>

      <description>Concurrency ! easy is  Concurrency is of paramount importance in modern computing. It is a complex domain in itself, with major contributions from database development, machine learning, distributed application deployment, and academia.
Python requires a clear and simple concurrency framework as it is commonly used in high-compute settings like training neural networks. Matrix algebra has been made fast with NumPy and related tools, interfacing with C to get large performance improvements.</description>

      <description>Eat my spheres!  You find yourself trapped in a room with Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies. There is a wood box of 100 spheres, some of them steel ball bearings and some of them gumballs. Jigsaw tells you that you can leave the room alive if you guess the number of steel ball bearings in the jar correctly. You can pull 10 random spheres out the 100 in the box as many times as you want, but each time you do, you have to eat all of them (yum!</description>

      <description>Update 2019-10-25: Added MLE derivation and OLS $ \sigma^2 $
I have learned linear regression a number of times with varying of levels of detail. I&amp;rsquo;m making this document mostly as a reference for myself and any others who may be interested in the technique.
The concepts and explanations here come either from An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR) or The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESLR). Other sources are listed at the bottom.</description>

      <title>jupyter with docker</title>

      <description>I love docker. It makes environments:
 portable across any machine subject to version control (retraceable and recoverable history) easily deployed and discarded with simple commands  Jupyter is a great tool that allows for the creation of nice looking documents consisting of ordered code chunks with inline output. It is a fantastic way to get started with programming, clearly step through your workflow, and/or create stories and presentations out of your work.</description>

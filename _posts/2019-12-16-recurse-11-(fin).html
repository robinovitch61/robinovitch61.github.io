title: Recurse 11 (fin)

<div class="post">

<p>Well, I've gone from RC to moving back to San Francisco and now sitting on a plane to the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p>Recurse is over! It happened! What an excellent time.</p>

<p>I got a lot out of projects, reading, meet ups, interviewing and online courses. The study and research was deep and rewarding.</p>

<p>In the end, though, I got as much or more from being around the people at RC as I did the studying itself. When friends and family would ask me why I chose RC over some other program, I would include in my explanation that RC seemed to "produce incredibly bright and creative people that I want to emulate". This last week, I realized that was actually poorly said - it isn't that RC produces good people. It attracts people that share a set of ideas about themselves and the world that strongly correlate with a variety of awesome outcomes. These ideas include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Learning and exploration is an act of continuing to become. There is no age or experience level or immutable obstacle that prevents becoming.</li>
    <li>Asking and reacting to questions is an art in itself. The right questions and answers are more conversational than transational. All parties learn something without feeling like they at one point had to impede progress towards the truth by proving that, despite not knowing all things, they are indeed smart and worthy of each others time and attention.</li>
    <li>Trying shit out is paramount to understanding. Interactivity unlocks progress.</li>
    <li>Computers are magic. Not because they can't be explained, but because of their endless power to engage and involve and generate experiences. Programmers are witches and wizards. It is important to wield the power with proper levels of respect and thoughtfulness.</li>
    <li>Humans matter. Being kind and working to elevate one another is a prime directive.</li>
</ul>

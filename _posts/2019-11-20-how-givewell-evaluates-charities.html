<p><a href="https://www.givewell.org/">Givewell</a> is one of the most admirable philanthropic organizations out there. They recognize and act upon a number of important truths:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Money is a super powerful tool for reducing harm in the world</li>
    <li>Money can be used in more and less effective ways</li>
    <li>The effectiveness of money can be modeled with finite (but often large) uncertainty bounds at a high confidence level</li>
    <li>Encouraging those with the means to donate money to effective causes is important and worthwhile</li>
    <li>Moral judgement is an inseparable part of judging the effectiveness of an outcome</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only does Givewell maintain an active <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/">blog</a>, a <a href="https://www.givewell.org/giving101">Giving 101</a> section of its site, run free events in the Bay Area every few months and deliver well-curated <a href="https://www.givewell.org/formstack/email-signup">email updates</a>, but they keep updated copies of their <a href="https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models">Cost Effectiveness Models</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKq-MNU-xtn_48uN33L6VvBEZRAduvjwWMeaEffL4K4/edit">Guide to Cost Effective Analysis'</a> available online for everyone to view. Transparency is <a href="https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/transparency">explicitly laid out</a> as a core value of the organization.</p>

<p>After digging through some of this available content in detail, I'd like to lay out a few key points and assumptions as clear a manner as possible.</p>

<p>First, they talk about the relationship between income ($$$) and consumption (value of used of goods and services). It is difficult to infer one from the other - for example, a household's crop production may contribute to consumption (if they consume the crops), income (if they sell the crops), or both.</p>

<p>Givewell states:
    <blockquote>When modeling interventions that we expect will alter people's productivity or work success, we prefer to think in terms of consumption rather than income...Consumption measurements are in some sense "the gold standard" for measures of material well-being in development economics research. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKq-MNU-xtn_48uN33L6VvBEZRAduvjwWMeaEffL4K4/edit#">Source</a>)</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, research often only provides data on income, as consumption is more difficult to measure. A reasonable approximation is to assume that consumption and income are equivalent:</p>

</figure>

<p>From this point forward in my discussion and in all Givewell documentation, it is reasonable to think of income and consumption as equivalent unless otherwise stated. I will arbitrarily choose to use the term consumption.</p>

<p>When examining consumption in relation to well-being (well-being representing self-reported happiness, decrease in suffering, hope for the future, etc.), it's intuitively true that increasing consumption linearly would yield diminishing returns in well-being. At low levels of consumption, an extra $10/day may result in a doubling or tripling of one's well being! At high levels of consumption, an extra $10/day may feel almost like an insult if its meant to measurably increase ones well-being - the economic equivalent of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW-wTkUBBeo">"you want a cookie or something?"</a>.</p>

    <figcaption class="figcaption-text"></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another idea: rather than a linear increase in consumption increasing well-being a proportional amount, a doubling in consumption increases well-being a proportional amount. So $10/day to $20/day increases well-being an equivalent amount as $5,000/day to $10,000/day. This is a logarithmic relationship, in this case base 2 for a doubling. In practice, Givewell uses base \( e \approx 2.72 \), which isn't much different.</p>

<p>For each base on the plot below, it can be said that "well-being increases an equivalent amount (one unit) each time consumption is multiplied by {the base}".

</figure>

<p>This is assumption is supported in <a href="http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/Satiation(AER).pdf">this research</a> which provides the plot shown below. Givewell recognizes that "The actual relationship between well-being and wealth is hotly debated." (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKq-MNU-xtn_48uN33L6VvBEZRAduvjwWMeaEffL4K4/edit#">Source</a>).</p>

<p>The above research shows one measure on the y-axis: the satisfaction ladder, a measure of self-reported happiness. Givewell extrapolates this research such that the y-axis can just represent well-being of any metric. This is reasonable as long as the assumption that a linear-logarithmic relationship exists between consumption and the metric serving as a proxy for well-being.</p>

<p>The constant slope for the linear-logarithmic model can be calculated for a given change in consumption. Givewell asks "what would be the increase in well-being per a doubling of consumption from \(c_1\) to \(2c_1\)?". This doubling of consumption is chosen arbitrarily and doesn't have anything to do with the base of the model - logarithmic base remains \(e\).</p>

\[ Slope = \frac{x}{\log{2c_1} - \log{c_1}} \]
\[ = \frac{x}{\log{\frac{2c_1}{c_1}}} \]
\[ = \frac{x}{\log{2}} \]
\[ \approx 1.443x \]

<p>The question here is what is \(x\)? Well, \(x\) is the amount well-being increased when consumption doubled. This could be read off the satisfaction ladder plot above, but then it would only be the slope for that particular well-being metric.</p>

      <description>This is a diagram from an open source project I was evaluating at work recently, and the subsequent conversations I had:
  Me: So their solution is push based?
Coworker: No, I think they just specify the general protocol.
Me: But those lines from the squares at the top to the central circle sort of look like arrows, don&amp;rsquo;t they? And their client pushes data&amp;hellip;I think maybe it&amp;rsquo;s push based?</description>

      <description>A pannable, mouse-centered zoomable, HTML5 canvas template in React + Typescript. You&amp;rsquo;d think this would be a solved problem, but despite the plethora of solutions out there, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get quite what I wanted for some time. Finally, here it all is in one place for future me and others to use as boilerplate for their embedded interactive canvases in their apps.
If you see any bugs or possible improvements, please comment on the gist here:</description>

      <description>Last month, I participated in advent of code for the first time. Everyday from Dec 1st through 25th, a problem is released. Each problem requires some programming to solve, and is split into two separate but related parts.
The problem statements link to an overarching narrative involving a character going on vacation and encountering a number of technical difficulties, e.g. implementing a ticket reader for the train or a fixing the boot code in your neighbours airplane video game console.</description>

      <description>This is a bit of an uncomfortable public post for me. Talking about money in general can be uncomfortable, and talking about giving money can just come off as self-congratulatory. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s an important topic that will have positive impact when talked about more often.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been excited about GiveWell for a while now, and am interested in exploring the idea of doing the most good with money, time and effort.</description>

      <description>Twitter bird - blue or purple?  About 6 weeks ago, I launched colorcontroversy.com. Since then, the site has collected over 800,000 color judgements and been shared around the web more than I expected.
A much-simplified version of Randal Monroe of XKCD&amp;rsquo;s color survey, the site shows you a color shade and presents two color choices for that shade. For example, it shows you a dark turquoise and asks you if it&amp;rsquo;s Green or Blue.</description>

      <description>I have been very fortunate to remain employed during this global pandemic. My productivity working from home has been about on par with what I had in the office, although my learning rate has gone down a bit due to the lack of water-cooler style chats about the product and software in general. We use Slack for remote chat and it feels a bit too formal to trigger notifications for offhand questions.</description>

      <description>Over the past year or so, I have gifted friends a few websites. I think the sites are fun, relatively unique gifts. As a bonus serve, they illustrate some of my progression with basic html/css/javascript static websites.
Site 1: averyrobins.com   I set up an Amazon S3 bucket for static hosting, bought a namecheap domain name, configured the custom DNS, and voila - I now pay $1/month to host this profanity-laden ASCII art.</description>

      <description>In the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from RC in Brooklyn to moving back to San Francisco to currently sitting on a plane to the Dominican Republic.
Recurse is over! It happened! What an excellent time.
I got a lot out of projects, reading, meet ups, interviewing and online courses. The study and research was varied and rewarding.
In the end, though, I got as much or more from being around the people at RC as the individual study.</description>

      <description>&amp;#39;Chad, destroyer of worlds&amp;#39; - circa 2015  My second to last week at RC was first spent in San Francisco at onsite interviews for positions in the city. Interviews went well and I had a nice time seeing some friends while there.
Unfortunately, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough time to finish the compiler of nand2tetris! The first week where I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished my nand2tetris project :&#39;(. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try my best to finish up both the compiler and OS this final week, though!</description>

      <description>In my third to last week of RC (!!!), I learned about Nix, Jest for Test Driven Development in Javascript, completed project 10 of nand2tetris, and continued interview prep.
Project 10 consists of the first half of the Jack compiler. The overall compiler is split in to tokenization + lexical analysis (project 10) and VM code generation (project 11).
The first half of the compiler was the most time consuming project of the course so far.</description>

      <description>Aqua Teen Hunger Force&amp;#39;s Mooninites  This week, I completed Nand2Tetris project 9, wrote about Givewell, and continued interview prep.
Nand2Tetris&#39; gets you used to programming in the high-level &amp;ldquo;Jack&amp;rdquo; programming language. It would be difficult (or at least, less meaningful) to write a compiler for a high level language that you don&amp;rsquo;t really understand.
I found it useful in that it solidified the rules of Jack and allowed me to project my thoughts of what the compiler would be doing to translate Jack code to VM Code.</description>

      <description>Note: this is my personal commentary and this post is not officially endorsed by Givewell in any way.
Givewell is one of the most admirable philanthropic organizations out there. They recognize and act upon a number of important truths:
 Money is a super powerful tool for reducing harm in the world Money can be used in more and less effective ways The effectiveness of money can be modeled with finite (possibly wide) uncertainty bounds at a non-trivial confidence level Encouraging those with the means to donate money to effective causes is important and worthwhile Moral judgement is an inseparable part of judging the effectiveness of an outcome  Not only does Givewell maintain an active blog, a Giving 101 section of its site, run free events in the Bay Area every few months and deliver well-curated email updates, but they keep updated copies of their Cost Effectiveness Models and Guide to Cost Effective Analysis available online for everyone to view.</description>

      <description>Recurse continues!
Each successive number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the two prior numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
While learning about algorithms and doing nand2tetris, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across the Fibonacci Sequence a number of times. Here are a 5 ways to calculate the Nth element of the sequence:
Method 1: Recursion Recursion is when a function calls itself. Intuitively, it&amp;rsquo;s a top down approach to problem solving.</description>

      <description>I wrapped up Nand2Tetris project 6 and completed project 7 this week. One satisfying thing about this course has been consistently connecting the &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; implementations that the course outlines to the hyper complex implementations in the real world.
Project 7 outlined the idea of multi-stage compilation. Take a high level language and compile it to a &amp;ldquo;Virtual Machine Code&amp;rdquo;, with readable but lower level syntax. This &amp;ldquo;intermediate representation&amp;rdquo; can then be compiled further through assembly to machine code (the 1s and 0s) for a specific hardware platform (e.</description>

      <description>Concurrency ! easy is  Concurrency is of paramount importance in modern computing. It is a complex domain in itself, with major contributions from database development, machine learning, distributed application deployment, and academia.
Python requires a clear and simple concurrency framework as it is commonly used in high-compute settings like training neural networks. Matrix algebra has been made fast with NumPy and related tools, interfacing with C to get large performance improvements.</description>

      <description>This week, the hack computer&amp;rsquo;s hardware was completed with project 5 of Nand2Tetris! I decided to write the remaining software portion of the course (projects 6-12) in Rust, feeding two birds with one scone.
 The Mandelbrot set with Rust Source: http://downloads.codecoding.com/rust/Programming%20Rust.pdf  While I started learning Rust with the the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Book, I&amp;rsquo;ve found The Rust Programming Language and Rustlings to be great resources as well. It was also incredibly helpful when Evan installed Rust Language Server (RLS) in my VSCode environment, making it easy to view source code and highlighting errors before compile time.</description>

There is a wood box of 100 spheres, some of them steel ball bearings and some of them gumballs. Jigsaw tells you that you can leave the room alive if you guess the number of steel ball bearings in the jar correctly. You can pull 10 random spheres out the 100 in the box as many times as you want, but each time you do, you have to eat all of them (yum!</description>

      <description>This week, I completed project 4 of Nand2Tetris, updated my resume and converted it to a responsive web page, and learned a whole lot about linear regression.
Nand2Tetris project 4 breaks away from the Hardware Description Language of the first three projects and moves in to a pseudo assembly code. This assembly language is specifically written for the &amp;ldquo;Hack&amp;rdquo; computer that the class builds up through the first six projects. Writing in &amp;ldquo;assembly&amp;rdquo; is one step down from writing in something like C - there is no automatic memory management, only a couple registers to play with, lots of referencing addresses with pointers and semi-roundabout ways of doing things.</description>

D3.js is a widely used javascript library for creating beautiful, interactive visualizations on the web. I made quite a simple interactive sine wave plotter, but the exercise took hours and really helped me gain insight in to D3&amp;rsquo;s declarative approach to data-centric object manipulation. Code for the thing here.</description>

Computer architecture work has come from the awesome Nand2Tetris course by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan. Shimon has a fantastic Ted Talk about the course and many Recursers have done it in the past. I&amp;rsquo;m 2 projects in to the first half of the course (Coursera link)
The premise is that you start with a Nand (&amp;ldquo;Not And&amp;rdquo;) logic gate.</description>

      <description>I love docker. It makes environments:
 portable across any machine subject to version control (retraceable and recoverable history) easily deployed and discarded with simple commands  Jupyter is a great tool that allows for the creation of nice looking documents consisting of ordered code chunks with inline output. It is a fantastic way to get started with programming, clearly step through your workflow, and/or create stories and presentations out of your work.</description>
